## Complete The Code

Hello and welcome to Complete The Code. This is the second alternate reality game (ARG) that the robots of dbrand, a skin manufacturer, have put on. We know of two phases of CTC2 so far. We have solved phase 1 and phase two is “initializing”. This site serves as place where we can collect all the info.&#x20;

## CTC2 Phase 2 - UNSOLVED

The website [https://completethecodetwo.cards/](https://completethecodetwo.cards) was discovered on May 26, 2021 as part of phase I.

@zeveryx created a [site](https://ctc2.zevaryx.com) that logs guesses. It’s identical to the dbrand site (same code and everything) and it's built on the same database that [J.A.R.V.I.S.](https://git.zevaryx.com/stark-industries/j.a.r.v.i.s.) uses, so guesses carry over. @Vcubed has also made a google sheet, but it looks to be broken at the time of writing.

The site may not accept any answers at this time, or it could accept multiple. it’s impossible to know.

On 4/1/22 we recived the dbrand diy kit drop, at the time of writing, it doesn't appear to have anything to do with CTC2

### Information collected so far

The site only consists of a text box with a placeholder of ???.

The site accepts any text input, which it then sends that via a POST request to [https://completethecodetwo.cards/pw](https://completethecodetwo.cards/pw). If the input if wrong it’ll return a “Nope.” (403), if the input is correct it will most likely return a 200 or 3XX.

Our end goal is to find the input that won’t return a 403.

Additionally, the files used by the website can be found [here](https://github.com/Complete-the-Code/ctc2-phase-2/tree/master/page-files/)

### What is this? (Part 2)

On May 26, 2021, some dipshit in the dbrand Discord server (@liatschulz) found the website [https://completethecodetwo.cards](https://completethecodetwo.cards) by using a brain. We have confirmed that the site was created by dbrand using WHOIS records. dbrand has since confirmed that Phase I has been completed and that Phase II has now been started. You can view the message [here](https://discord.com/channels/520021794380447745/832309320934621234/847171349113471046)

We have a bunch of dipshits on Discord that have been trying to figure out what the password to the website is.

## CTC2 Phase 1 - SOLVED

As of May 17, 2021, dbrand has “confirmed” that all 23 cards have been acquired, you can see the message in the pinned section of the CTC2 discord channel or by clicking [here](https://discord.com/channels/520021794380447745/832309320934621234/843974368287653939) . Additionally they have confirmed that we have everything needed, to solve this challenge.

Thanks to @liatschulz in the Discord, they have managed to mash the character list to find the url [https://completethecodetwo.cards/](https://completethecodetwo.cards)

We have confirmed that this is indeed a dbrand created website using WHOIS records. dbrand has since confirmed that Phase I has been completed and that Phase II has now been started.

### Known characters:

`ACDDEEEEHLMOOOPRSTTTW`

### What is this?

On April 1, 2021, dbrand started selling face masks again. You were able to add a “Surprise” to your purchase for an extra 10 USD, which turned out to be a robot camo mask.

Once the face masks started getting delivered after they shipped on April 12, 2021, the robot camo mask also included a card.

Using the Zodiac Z340 Cipher the back text decrypts to `POSTANDSEARCHONTWITTER`. This is the same on every card. On the front of the card there is a singular Zodiac Killer Symbol. These can vary and we are looking for such symbols!

We have a bunch of dipshits on Discord that have been trying to figure out what exactly the backs of the cards are supposed to mean.

~~If you have a symbol please post the image in the~~ [~~Discord~~](https://discord.gg/dbrand)\~\~ or\~\~ [~~Subreddit~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand)\~\~ !, additionally you can post it on Twitter using\~\~ [~~#CTC2~~](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CTC2)\~\~ .\~\~ We have acquired all the cards, so this is no longer necessary

Cards that have been collected so far can be seen [here](https://phase1.completethecode.com/acquiredSymbols) .
